Like Flask, but with tiddlers and TiddlyWeb.

Maybe a joke, maybe not.

tiddlybeaker/__init__.py contains the basics for supporting
stubapp.py, a simple web app which serves content from
http://0.0.0.0:8080/carp when you run python stubapp.py.

The exploration thus far has uncovered why frameworks like Flask do things
like the Werkzeug "Context Locals" (see http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/docs/local/):
without them you need to constantly passing around a context variable, like
environ, which means boilerplate, which these framework things are supposed
to eschew.

Since I didn't feel like writing a context manager, our handlers temporarily
accept a 'b' variable, which reference a Request object.

This is not meant for consumption, unless you're feeling feckless.
